# Rust Notes

## Wot?

I'm trying to learn Rust, so this is where I'm gonna stick my notes and projects from following along in the book and such. I don't really expect anyone else to use this repo or even look at it, but I absolutely despise repos without a README, so yeah.

## Why?

Because I find this way of learning easy, and it gives me stuff to reference later on that isn't a 3 hour YouTube video.

Having quick examples of syntax and such that I can read in-IDE just works for me, idk why. Yes it's weird.
